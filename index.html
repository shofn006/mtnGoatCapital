            <h3>MICRO-MIDDLE MARKET COMMITMENT</h3>
            <p>
              Small businesses are principally overlooked by private equity firms as they seek lower-middle market and larger deals. This results in a discrepancy between the number of businesses looking for partnerships and the amount of capital and value-add available to them.
